## Python OAuth2 Token Retrieval Example

This Python script demonstrates how to obtain an OAuth2 access token from an authorization server using the authorization code flow. It's a basic example that uses the `requests` library to make an HTTP POST request to the token endpoint of the authorization server.

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (Install using `pip install requests`)
- Registered OAuth client with `client_id` and `client_secret`
- Authorization code obtained after user authorization

### Code:

```python
import os
import requests

# OAuth client credentials from environment variables
client_id = os.getenv('OAUTH_CLIENT_ID')
client_secret = os.getenv('OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET')

# Your application's callback URL
redirect_uri = 'https://yourwebsite.com/callback'

# Authorization code received from the authorization server
authorization_code = 'ReceivedAuthorizationCode'

# Token endpoint URL of the authorization server
token_url = 'https://authorization-server.com/oauth/token'

# Data payload for the token request
data = {
    'grant_type': 'authorization_code',
    'client_id': client_id,
    'client_secret': client_secret,
    'redirect_uri': redirect_uri,
    'code': authorization_code,
}

# HTTP headers for the request
headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'}

# Creating a session to manage the request
with requests.Session() as session:
    response = session.post(token_url, data=data, headers=headers)

    # Checking the response status code
    if response.status_code == 200:
        # Parsing the access token from the response
        token_data = response.json()
        access_token = token_data.get('access_token')
        print(f"Access Token: {access_token}")
    else:
        # Handling errors
        print(f"Error obtaining access token: {response.text}")
```

What’s an OAuth Token Anyway?

Imagine you’ve got a magic key, but instead of opening doors, it lets apps peek into your stuff online without ever knowing your password. That’s what an OAuth token is like. It’s this special code that says, “Hey, it’s cool, they’re with me,” to websites or apps you’re trying to interact with, without actually handing over the keys to your digital kingdom.

Why Do We Even Need These Tokens?

So, you know how annoying it is to create a new account everywhere? Enter a password here, another one there. Well, OAuth tokens are here to save the day. They let you use your Google, Facebook, or whatever account to log into other stuff online. No new passwords, no fuss. And the best part? If some sneaky hacker gets their hands on this token, the worst they can do is mess with that one thing, not your entire account.

What’s the Deal with the Script?

Alright, this script we’re talking about? It’s pretty much a DIY kit for dealing with these OAuth tokens.

	1.	Automating Boring Stuff: If you’re making an app and you need to talk to another service (like getting your latest tweets or checking your Google calendar), this script can handle the “Please let me in” part automatically. Super handy for keeping things smooth and automated.
	2.	Playing Nice with Others: Got an app that needs to grab info from somewhere else? This script helps you do that without being creepy about user passwords. It’s all about asking nicely for access.
	3.	Building Your Own Thing: If you’re crafting something that needs to peek into users’ data from another service, this script is like asking, “Hey, can I check this out?” but in code. Users are cool with it because it doesn’t feel like giving away their house keys.
	4.	Talking Amongst Yourselves: If you’ve got a bunch of different parts of your app talking to each other, this script can help them authenticate, kind of like showing ID at a club. It keeps things secure without making it a hassle.
